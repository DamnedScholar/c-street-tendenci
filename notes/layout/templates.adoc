## Tendenci Theme Update
The base theme is kind of a mess.
* `base.html` is the top-level parent, and `default.html` and `default-fullwidth.html` fill in the basic HTML body content, but then `base-wide.html` and `base-column.html` inherit from those. It's confusing to have different files called "base" at different levels of the family tree.
* There doesn't seem to be a good way for individual page types to decide whether they should have a sidebar or not, if the sidebar is declared in `default.html`. They can make their own, but that's a bad move for maintenance if there are two potential sidebars.
* I should run `prettier` on all the theme files.
  - Once I do, I should submit a PR to the `tendenci` repo.

### Significant Changes
* In the case of files that had "-new" added to their name, the overriding template will be named according to the original name (which makes it easy for me to switch back and forth if I need to; eg. `top_menu/admin_top.html` vs `top_menu/admin_top-new.html`).
* The inline edit links are inconsistently styled. This makes it difficult to change the look and feel of these links across the whole site and impossible to find them with JS. I can override each of them to make them consistent, and perhaps a PR is in order.
  - `navs` looks in `navs/cached_nav.html` and spits out `.t-admin-inline`. The class name makes sense and is unique, but the template name is weird for being the universal entrypoint into the app.
  - `boxes` uses `.admin-inline` from `boxes/edit-link.html`. The template name seems perfect here.
  - Do we really need text after "Edit" for those buttons? It should be obvious what you're editing from the button's position.

#### Dashboard App
* Why, oh why, is the main page for `dashboard` named `new.html` when there's an `index.html` in the same folder?

#### Navs App
* There's a `ul` in `header.html` outside the `<% nav %>` tags, when the `navs` app spawns a `ul`. There should only be one, and it should be inside the app's templates.
* Why is there a `.t-main-navbar-nav` that doesn't get used for anything in the CSS? It's next to `#t-main-navbar-nav-[num]` which is also unused. These names are confusing and non-expressive and should be limited. Anywhere I see something like that, I'm removing the `class` and changing the `id` to something straightforward like `#t-navbar-[num]`.
* There are too many view functions, and templates that never actually get used.
  - eg: The `{% nav %}` tag loads `cached_nav` which calls `load_nav`. The templates `nav` and `navigation` never get used even though they sound like the logical entrypoints.

### Things to Do
* I hardcoded the link to the template JS in `base.html`. This is bad and should be replaced by a dynamic link as soon as possible.
* The top-level `nav` listing has been made compatible with the Stimulus dropdown controller, but nested dropdowns still rely on Bootstrap. Fixing this may require some thinking.

### Things to Consider
* Should I replace all dropdowns with https://github.com/estevanmaito/tailwindcss-dropdown?
