## Bundles are kind of big
* I'm not making an AJAX application, just a site I'd like to look pretty. I can probably replace JQuery down the line with Alpine.js (https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine) by replacing the Bootstrap interactive components with Alpine code. The code can live peacefully in Django templates, since Alpine works at run time.
* Once Alpine is handling the interactive parts, the Bootstrap integration can be converted to Tailwind. Tailwind expects to be part of the build pipeline and engages in tree-shaking, so it should be a piece of cake to plug it into the current workflow. Browsing the Tailwind docs, I'm half wondering if I should bother converting more to Bootstrap.

## A more interactive site might want to feel like AJAX
* `django-sockpuppet` allows for sending data back to the server and reloading the template. Alpine could make HTTP requests, but integrating the state management into Django could be useful. This requires a page reload whenever it happens, so that the server can re-render the template.
