<h2>Mission</h2>
<p>The CID (Community Improvement District) is a local governmental subdivision put in place by voters in the federally recognized Historic Commercial Street district. It was initially founded in 2005 for a period of 15 years and renewed in 2019. The CID is governed by a board of directors and run in a manner similar to a not-for-profit entity, with operating revenues principally derived from a percentage of sales taxes paid in the district. Projects funded by the CID include, but aren't limited to, the landscaping of the street and the maintenance of this site.</p>

CID meetings take place at the <a href="/savoy-ballroom">Savoy Ballroom</a> on the second Wednesday of each month. The meeting runs from 10:00 - 11:00.
