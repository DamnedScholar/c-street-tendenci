<h2>Getting Involved</h2>
<h3>Locals</h3>
<p>The Commercial Club is a valuable connection for any business or entrepreneur looking to build a strong foundation with our community. Member dues are entirely spent on enhancing the quality of life in the district for all stakeholders, and the Club is actively involved in raising outside funds, so the minor cost of buying in quickly turns into an investment.</p>

<h3>Solicitation</h3>
<p>If you would like to speak at a meeting, you should send a message to <a href="mailto:CID@HistoricCStreet.com">CID@HistoricCStreet.com</a> to request that the President put you on the agenda. If possible, please give notice by the Friday before the meeting.</p>

<h3>Philanthropy</h3>
<p>The Commercial Club is not a registered non-profit, but maintains a relationship with the Community Foundation of the Ozarks, which is able to receive tax-deductible donations on behalf of the Club for certain activities. One such project is the Jefferson Avenue Footbridge, which has a CFO-managed account to raise funds for its restoration and continued maintenance.</p>
