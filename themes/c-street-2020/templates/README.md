## Tendenci Theme Update
In order to update the site to Bootstrap 4 compatibility, a significant number of base theme pages may need to be overridden to apply new styles. Django makes it easy to do this. In the case of files that had "-new" added to their name, the overriding template will be named according to the original name (which makes it easy for me to switch back and forth if I need to; eg. `top_menu/admin_top.html` vs `top_menu/admin_top-new.html`).
